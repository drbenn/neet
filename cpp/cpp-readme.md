# CPP Noob readme

## Getting started

- I have g++ (GNU C++ Compiler) installed. Check with:
```g++ --version```

- write .cpp file

- navigate to directory and compile file like so to create executable(-o stands for output):
```g++ hello.cpp -o my_app.exe```

- now run the executable with:
```./my_app.exe```

- you can also compile and then run the executable in 1 line with the following:
```g++ hello.cpp -o my_app.exe && ./my_app.exe```
